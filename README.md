# ITM-618-Course-Project

This was the course project for my ITM 618 Business Analytics course. The goal of the project was to use the training data to train a model that predicts whether or not a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. There is a write up for the project that gives my reationale and analysis or performance, as well.
